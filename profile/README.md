## 👋 What we build

OODARIS AI is an **agentic OS for retailers**.

We move merchants, planners, and supply teams off spreadsheet-era MFP / MP&A suites and into a governed network of AI agents that:

- Sense demand across POS, e‑commerce, marketing, and external signals  
- Optimize buys, pricing, and inventory across channels and regions  
- Orchestrate decisions with explainable guardrails and human‑in‑the‑loop workflows  

All of it runs on a **Semantic & Canonical Data Fabric** that keeps every agent in sync with your real systems.

---

## 📈 Outcomes we’ve proven

We ship production systems with audited impact, not toy demos.

- **+2–8pp gross margin improvement** ranges across audited omnichannel pilots  
- **60–75% fewer stockouts** on priority SKUs in enterprise rollouts  
- **50–200% annual ROI**, with **4–8 month payback** windows  
- **62% fewer manual hours** on planning workflows in validated pilots  

See the full benchmarks, guarantees, and methodology on our website.

## 🧠 The OODARIS Agentic OS (at a glance)

At the core is the **OODARIS loop** — Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Reflect → Iterate → Serve — implemented as a governed, multi‑agent system grounded in BDI (Belief‑Desire‑Intention) architecture.

Key building blocks:

- **Retail DNA**  
  Built by former merchants and planners. Agents ship with retail-native concepts, not generic LLM prompts.

- **Semantic & Canonical Data Fabric**  
  Maps and matches data from POS, e‑com, ERP, marketing, logistics, and finance into a shared semantic blackboard.

- **Agent Cohort & Orchestrator**  
  Specialized agents (demand, price, inventory, finance, procurement, etc.) collaborate over the blackboard. An orchestrator routes work, enforces guardrails, and narrates decisions.

- **Governance & Explainability**  
  Coordinator, critic, and storyteller agents audit each other and emit human‑readable rationales for every action.

    Retail data  →  Semantic & Canonical Data Fabric  →  Agent Cohort  →  Humans-in-the-loop
    (POS, e‑com, ERP, CRM, etc.)          (Demand, Price, Inventory, Finance)        (Merchants, Planners, Ops)

## 🤝 Agents in the loop

We ship a roster of specialized agents that cooperate in real time across the retail lifecycle.

| Domain                        | Example agents                                             | What they help you do                                           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer & Market Intelligence | Trend Intelligence Scout · Market Insights Analyst · Demand Intelligence | Spot emerging trends, benchmark competitors, and improve demand forecasts. |
| Merchandising & Experience   | New Product Catalyst · Assortment Curator · Pricing Strategist · Promotions Director | Launch new items, localize assortments, steer price & promotions with proof. |
| Planning & Finance           | MFP Planner · OTB Controller                               | Synchronize merch & financial plans, protect cash and margin.   |
| Supply & Fulfillment         | Inventory Optimizer · Replenishment Director · Procurement Navigator | Balance inventory, automate replenishment, and improve sourcing economics. |

  A book introducing the BDI framework and OODARIS loop for autonomous retail systems.

- **Research & publications**  
  Deep dives on:  
  - BDI architecture in retail contexts  
  - The OODARIS loop methodology  
  - Multi‑agent coordination patterns  
  - Demand sensing, inventory optimization, and agentic pricing

## 🛠 For developers & data teams

This GitHub organization is where we expose the pieces of our platform that make sense to share publicly:

- **Reference architectures & diagrams**  
  High‑level views of the Agentic OS: data fabric, agent cohort, and governance layer.

- **SDKs & integration kits** *(as they are released)*  
  - Client libraries for integrating with the OODARIS Agentic OS  
  - Example adapters for common retail systems (POS, ERP, e‑com, marketing)

- **Labs & examples** *(as they are released)*  
  - Notebooks demonstrating agent behaviours in synthetic retail environments  
  - Evaluation harnesses for margin, stockout, and working‑capital metrics

<!--
TODO: When public repos are available, add direct links here and pin them on the organization profile.
Example:
- [`oodaris-labs`](https://github.com/oodaris/oodaris-labs)
- [`agentic-retail-starter`](https://github.com/oodaris/agentic-retail-starter)
-->

If you’re evaluating OODARIS for your retail stack today, reach out and we’ll connect you with a governed pilot environment rather than a toy demo.

## 🧪 How we build

We are a **senior, calm team** shipping production multi‑agent systems for enterprise retailers.

A few principles we hold:

- **Golden workflow:** Plan → Contracts → Code → Tests → Docs → Rollout. Every change follows this path.  
- **Typed & observable by default:** Strongly‑typed inputs/outputs, structured logs, traces, and dashboards before we ship.  
- **No heroics:** High trust, high ownership, realistic scope. We solve hard problems with focus, not chaos.
